Low cost, low risk, but it lets the city test if it fixes the problem before committing to a big build.

I can have her and a few other parents write quick notes or even agree to chat with the rep if needed\u2014that\u2019ll add so much weight to our pitch. And the temporary pilot crosswalk? Brilliant! My regulars are always complaining about waiting forever for the city to act on big projects; this shows immediate, low-risk progress that everyone can get behind.
