I pulled local business data last week that shows 22% of downtown small businesses delayed expansion or inventory orders last quarter directly because of the fee hike, including three family-focused shops just like Isabella\u2019s. Here\u2019s my structured take on the framing: For local business owners, we propose a tiered fee structure based on annual revenue\u2014so the children\u2019s bookshop pays a fraction of what the out-of-town chain caf\u00e9 does, leveling the playing field. For general voters, we tie it to sustainable city budgeting: fairer fees will keep more small businesses open, which boosts consistent sales tax revenue long-term instead of relying on one-time, unpopular hikes. That way, we\u2019re addressing both the immediate pain of business owners and the Ville\u2019s long-term fiscal health. Once Isabella joins, we should definitely get her firsthand input as a small business owner too\u2014she knows exactly how these fees impact day-to-day operations.
